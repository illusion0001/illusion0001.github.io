# Intro

There's a rare bug in Uncharted 2 where if a player goes out of the normal playzone, dies, and quit to the menu, the game would crash.

Affected Consoles:

- ~~PlayStation 3~~ Unofficially Patched

- ~~PlayStation 4~~ Unofficially Patched

The issue still persists on latest patch 1.02 on PS4

## First Sight

Looking at instructions and fault address, assuming that 4b4 is SPU instruction and 0x620 for PS4, seems to be reading from an invalid memory address (access violation)

```
PS3 Stop Instruction:

00262e04 a0 1c 04 b4     lhz        r0,DAT_000004b4(r28)

Log from RPCS3

Thread (main_thread) [0x00262e04]} VM: Access violation reading location 0x4b4 (unmapped memory)

PS4 Stop Instruction:

000ade75 66 41 83        CMP        word ptr [R15 + 0x620],0x0
         bf 20 06 
         00 00 00

Mira Log from PS4

# reason: page fault (user read data, page not present)
# fault address: 0000000000000620
# rip: 00000000004ade75 
```

Data stops processing and left the registers with 0 when quitting to the menu during this specific case, causing the game to crash.

RPCS3: Breakpoint runtime.

RPCS3: Crash.

On Playstation 4, this is similar but in register R15 instead.

PS4: Reaper Breakpoint runtime.

PS4: Mira backtrace.

Looking at register data. R28 (PS3) and R15 (PS4) gets used during gameplay and are always executed and have data.

## Resolution

We add a check to compare against the base register (28 for PS3 and 15 for PS4 respectively)

Skip to load 1 into their needed register skip and return to normal code if isn't 0.

```yml
  # quit to menu fix ppc ver
  - [ be32, 0x00262e04, 0x488ce301 ] #Call to code cave
  - [ be32, 0x00b31104, 0x2f9c0000 ] #Compare r28 to 0
  - [ be32, 0x00b31108, 0x409e000c ] #Skip to lhz if !=0
  - [ be32, 0x00b3110c, 0x38000001 ] #r0 = 1
  - [ be32, 0x00b31110, 0x48000008 ] #Go to return
  - [ be32, 0x00b31114, 0xa01c04b4 ] #Default lhz
  - [ be32, 0x00b31118, 0x4e800020 ] #Return
```

```
  // quit to menu fix x86 ver
000ade75 e8 87 cc        CALL       SUB_006cab01 // code cave
         61 00
                             SUB_006cab01
006cab01 49 83 ff 00     CMP        R15,0x0 // compare r15 to 0
006cab05 0f 85 09        JNZ        LAB_006cab14 // go to lea
         00 00 00
006cab0b 48 c7 c7        MOV        RDI,0x1 // move rdi with 1
         01 00 00 00
006cab12 eb 07           JMP        LAB_006cab1b // Go to Compare
                     LAB_006cab14
006cab14 49 8d bf        LEA        RDI,[R15 + 0x620] // Lea from rdi to r15 + 620, no LEA in original code, does CMP instead
         20 06 00 00
                     LAB_006cab1b
006cab1b 48 83 ff 00     CMP        RDI,0x0 // if rdi 0
006cab1f c3              RET // Return
```

Let's implement this fix and see the results.

Awesome! No longer crashing when quitting to the menu.
