Recently, I stumped upon a video by a speedrunner [Anthony Caliber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4PlYBhe8mzGFW4lmIkIQsg) which shows a [Video](https://youtu.be/EaBFyrCyMbs?t=302) comparing differences between camera shakes.

I'm not much of a fan of sprinting camera shake myself so let's see what we can do about it.

## Diving into nothingness

Opening the executable in Ghidra and searching for `Disable Camera` gives few results. But these are just text strings, what are they for?

These seem to be leftovers from developer menu code.

For PS3. We can see here that it points to addresses.

```
012b1d98 01 4f 34 12     addr       DAT_014f3412 // byte
012b1d9c 00 ec 86 a0     addr       s_Disable_Camera_Additives_00ec86a0 // string
```

On PS4, there's a submenu dedicated to this.

```c
  uVar1 = FUN_00c81020(0xa0);
  FUN_00a29940(uVar1,"Show Camera Additives",FUN_00a298b0,&DAT_01524d28,0);
  FUN_00a2dcd0(param_1,uVar1);
  uVar1 = FUN_00c81020(0xa0);
  FUN_00a29940(uVar1,"Disable Camera Additives",FUN_00a31890,&DAT_01524d29,0);
  FUN_00a2dcd0(param_1,uVar1);
  uVar1 = FUN_00c81020(0xa0);
  FUN_00a29940(uVar1,"Allow Manual Camera Shake",FUN_00a31890,&DAT_0162d0aa,0);
  FUN_00a2dcd0(param_1,uVar1);
```

Let's activate this menu in-game.

Three options. What we are interested here is `Disable Camera Additives` Let's see what happens when we enable it.

</video>

No more camera shakes!

## Smoking Mirrors

Let's start with the PS3 version.

Going to `0x14f3412` in Memory and setting it to 1, does nothing. Why's that?

`0x14f3412` seems to be `Show Camera Additives` as `final` build configs have most debugging features stripped out, it doesn't do anything. Let's try byte next to it. 

<video controls width="1280" height="720">
  <source src="\assets\images\t1-camshake\t1-rpcs3-camshake-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Got it. No more camera shake for the PS3 version.

For The Last of Us, setting a breakpoint at startup and loading it's with register 11 as it holds value 1 setup by `009941e4 39 60 00 01     li         r11,0x1` made it work.

```yml
  - [ be16, 0x00994234, 0x997d ] # disable camera addtiv
```

## Causing Headaches

For Uncharted 3 however, things are not as cut and dry as one might think.

```
007e5884 38 00 00 01     li         r0,0x1
007e58ac e8 01 00 b0     ld         r0,0xb0(r1) // this will become important later
007e58cc 9b 9d 00 03     stb        r28,0x3(r29)
```

We can try loading it with register 0. But it doesn't work. Let's see in the debugger to find out why.

![](\assets\images\t1-camshake\uc3-rpcs3-camshake-dbgr.png)

r0 is now taken by instruction ld at `7e58ac` and we can't simply nop this and hope that the game will work. It does not.

Stuck at a deadend? Not so easy.

We can set a read breakpoint on `0x013257f3` and see where it will take us.

`008242cc 88 0b 00 03     lbz        r0,0x3(r11)=>DAT_013257f3`

Loading intermediate with register 0 did the trick.

```yml
  - [ be16, 0x008242cc, 0x3800 ]
```

Let's move on to the PS4 Version.

## Soothing for the eyes

We'll need to use a byte that writes on startup, searching for something, say.. `Enable OIT Assert` and going to it's reference, gives us what we need.

```
// uc3 1.00
0015f299 c6 80 62        MOV        byte ptr [RAX + 0x762]=>DAT_016491d2,0x1
         07 00 00 01
0015f2a0 c6 80 60        MOV        byte ptr [RAX + 0x760]=>DAT_016491d0,0x0
         07 00 00 00

// tlou 1.10
0000c2ff c6 83 ec        MOV        byte ptr [RBX + 0x6ec]=>DAT_0181ae5c,0x1
         06 00 00 01
0000c306 c6 83 ea        MOV        byte ptr [RBX + 0x6ea]=>DAT_0181ae5a,0x0
         06 00 00 00
```

Moving a byte on startup? Check. Let's use instruction next to it.

We know that `0x01524d29` is byte we wanted to load looking from it's menu code, we can change this instruction to load our desired byte instead.

```
// uc3 1.00
0015f2a0 c6 05 a2        MOV        byte ptr [DAT_013f9149],0x1
         9e 29 01 01

// tlou 1.10
0000c306 c6 05 1c        MOV        byte ptr [DAT_01524d29],0x1
         8a 51 01 01
```

<!-- embarrassing solution. why do I make things overcomplicated

but we don't have a lot of space to work with here.

To solve this, we can use a code cave.

Somewhere around `0xe7a553` is an unused function, let's use this address as our starting point.

```
// t1 1.10

0000c2ff 67 67 e8        CALL       SUB_00e7a553
                 4d e2 e6 00

00e7a553 c6 83 ec        MOV        byte ptr [RBX + 0x6ec],0x1 // load original byte
         06 00 00 01
00e7a55a c6 05 c8        MOV        byte ptr [DAT_01524d29],0x1 // load byte for cam shake
                 a7 6a 00 01
00e7a561 c3              RET // return
```

First `CALL` here is jumping to our new location. We *must* run original instruction before proceeding any further to retain original code flow.

`MOV        byte ptr [RBX + 0x6ec],0x1` loads our original byte overwrittin by our jump call.

`MOV        byte ptr [DAT_01524d29],0x1` loads our desired byte. In this case `Disable Camera Additives` as we saw from the snippet of menu code earlier. -->

## Patch

To apply patch and for use on an exploitable PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 console, you'll have to modify the executable with a hex editor and install it back onto the console.

For RPCS3 Emulator, simply download and enable through Patch Manager.
