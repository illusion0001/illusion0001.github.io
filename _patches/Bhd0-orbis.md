# end users ignore!!
# this is a note for other patch devs
# bhd0 is a little different than bhd1
# first array is game tick
# second array is simulated tick (what we are patching)
# setting both bits to 60.0f will result in double speed
# however, setting only the second bit to 60.0f result in 60fps and no speedup
# cc implemented game speed/frametime calc based on tickrate (absolute hacks :p) for win32 ver
# code path still exist which is why this is possible
