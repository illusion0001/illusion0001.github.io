# notes
# according to the re work at gpcs4
# https://github.com/Inori/GPCS4/blob/2cb81156a1a1fd914a46fbd99cecddd6f93e7dfd/GPCS4/SceModules/SceVideoOut/sce_videoout_types.h#L115-L123
# mode 2 is pretty much flip as soon as possible, or vsync off with eye sore screen tearing
# default is 3 which i guess is double buffered vsync
# it would be good if triple buffering worked here
# as it allows for 40-60 fps and not hard locking to 30-40 all the time
# on base hw.
# r13d loads into edx, which i think is param for SubmitFlip.
