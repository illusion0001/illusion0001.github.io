## 60 FPS Unlock (Work-In-Progress!)

Timer is currently double speed.

- [ ] Find dynamic timestep from Motorstorm PS3 or Driveclub VR titles. (requires brute forcing, how-to in patch comments, contact me on discord if you managed to get the game speed + sound pitch run at half speed globally.)

# notes for anyone wanting to help solve dynamic timestep
#
# game speed is 1.0f or 00 00 80 3f, on PS3 titles, one of the float controlls game and sound speed.
1.0f = 00 00 80 3f
0.5f = 00 00 00 3f
# there's over 10k results and replacing all is not an option
# if anyone has a better solution for patching bin
# via a patch file would be greatly appreciated.
# hex edit suck for brute forcing like this.
