        # mode 2 is pretty much flip as soon as possible, or vsync off with eye sore screen tearing
        # default is 3 which i guess is double buffered vsync
        # it would be good if triple buffering worked here
        # as it allows for 40-60 fps and not hard locking to 30-40 all the time
        # on base hw.
        # r13d loads into edx, which i think is param for SubmitFlip.
